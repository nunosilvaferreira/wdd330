WDD 330 - Final Project Proposal: "Couple Time" App
--------------------------------------------------

1. Overview
------------
Problem: Busy couples struggle to prioritize quality time, leading to emotional disconnect.
Solution: A web app that generates bonding activities, tracks shared goals, and fosters communication through guided interactions.
Motivation: Inspired by my parents' 30-year marriage—they credit "intentional moments" for their strong relationship.

2. Target Audience
------------------
Primary: Committed couples aged 25-45 with busy schedules.
Secondary: Marriage counselors (therapists at Family Clinic could recommend this as homework).

3. Major Functions (8+)
-----------------------
1. Activity Generator - Random couple activities filtered by time/mood (e.g., "15-min kitchen dance party").
2. Relationship Quiz - Open Trivia DB questions like "What’s your partner’s favorite childhood memory?"
3. Shared Journal - LocalStorage entries with photos/text (e.g., "Our 2025 hiking adventures").
4. Progress Tracker - Charts showing consistency in using the app (Chart.js).
5. Weekly Challenges - Goals like "Cook together twice this week" with EmailJS reminders.
6. Love Languages Quiz - Custom quiz to help couples understand each other’s needs.
7. Gratitude Wall - Shared space to post daily appreciations (Firebase).
8. Date Night Ideas - Pinterest-style cards with API-sourced recipes/movies.

4. Wireframes
-------------
[Mobile]
- Home: Activity card (CTA: "Surprise Us!") + navbar (Journal, Quiz, Challenges)
- Journal: Textarea + photo upload button + saved entries list

[Desktop]
- Dashboard: Activity generator (left), weekly progress chart (right), journal preview (bottom)

5. External Data Sources
------------------------
APIs:
1. BoredAPI (https://www.boredapi.com/) - Fetch activities with ?participants=2
   Sample data: {"activity":"Plan a dream vacation","type":"social","participants":2}
2. Quotable (https://api.quotable.io) - Get love/relationship quotes
   Sample: {"content":"Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.","author":"Aristotle"}

Stored Data:
- Firebase: Journal entries (timestamp, text, imageURL)
- localStorage: User preferences (dark mode, notification settings)

6. Module List
--------------
1. HTML: index.html, journal.html, quiz.html
2. CSS: styles.css (mobile-first), darkmode.css
3. JS: 
   - apiHandlers.js (BoredAPI/Quotable calls)
   - firebase.js (authentication/storage)
   - journalManager.js (CRUD operations)
4. Assets: SVG icons, default couple avatars

7. Graphic Identity
-------------------
- Colors: 
  Primary: #FF6B6B (warm pink) + #4ECDC4 (soft teal)
  Neutral: #F7FFF7 (off-white), #292F36 (dark text)
- Typography: 
  Headings: 'Playfair Display' (serif)
  Body: 'Nunito Sans' (sans-serif)
- Icon: Interlocked hearts with a clock face (symbolizing quality time)

8. Timeline
-----------
Week 5: 
- Core features (activity generator, journal)
- Basic UI with responsive design

Week 6: 
- API integrations (BoredAPI, Quotable)
- Firebase setup for data persistence

Week 7: 
- Polish animations/transitions
- Testing (peer review + bug fixes)

9. Trello Board
---------------

   Includes cards like:

- "Design journal entry component"

10. Challenges
--------------
1. Syncing Firebase data between devices in real-time
2. Making quizzes engaging without backend logic
3. Balancing playful design with therapeutic seriousness
